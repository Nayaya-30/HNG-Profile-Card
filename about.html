                    I'm a passionate frontend developer dedicated to
                    creating accessible, responsive, and user-friendly web
                    applications that are scalable, manageable, and
                    maintainable. My journey began with HTML and CSS since
                    2024 while I was a Mathematics undergraduate. Now a
                    graduate, and the journey is evolving into expertise with
                    modern JavaScript frameworks like React and a type
                    system library, TypeScript.

                        I'm constantly exploring new ways to blend design
                        and code — learning not just how things work, but
                        why they work that way. I value clean interfaces,
                        good documentation, and meaningful collaboration.
                        Every project is a chance to refine my process,
                        share what I learn, and grow into the kind of
                        developer who builds with purpose and empathy.

                    <p>
                        My goal is simple: keep growing, keep building, and
                        keep creating experiences that feel
                        effortless for users. I look forward to learning
                        from peers and mentors.
