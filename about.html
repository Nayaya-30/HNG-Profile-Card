			</h2>
			<div class="bio-content">
				<p>
					I'm a passionate frontend developer dedicated to
					creating accessible, responsive, and user-friendly web
					applications that are scalable, manageable, and

					graduate, and the journey is evolving into expertise with
					modern JavaScript frameworks like React and a type
					system library, TypeScript.
				</p>
				<p>
					I prioritize clean code, performance optimization, and
					inclusive digital experiences, ensuring every user can
					engage seamlessly with my work.

					Extra Thoughts
				</h2>
				<div class="content-block">
					<p>
						I'm constantly exploring new ways to blend design
						and code — learning not just how things work, but
						why they work that way. I value clean interfaces,
						good documentation, and meaningful collaboration.
						Every project is a chance to refine my process,
						share what I learn, and grow into the kind of
						developer who builds with purpose and empathy.
					</p>
					<p>
						My goal is simple: keep growing, keep building, and
						keep creating experiences that feel
						effortless for users. I look forward to learning
						from peers and mentors.
